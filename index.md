CycloneDX is a lightweight Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) standard designed for use in application security 
contexts and supply chain component analysis. 

The CycloneDX project provides standards in XML, JSON, and Protocol Buffers, as well as a large 
[collection of official and community supported tools](https://cyclonedx.org/tool-center/) that create or interoperate 
with the standard. 

The projects website has many documented [use cases and examples](https://cyclonedx.org/use-cases/) that provide a 
springboard to SBOM adoption. 

The project operates as meritocracy whose [guiding principals](https://cyclonedx.org/about/guiding-principles/) 
reinforce its [risk-based approach to standards development](https://cyclonedx.org/about/standardization-process/). 
The project encourages [community participation](https://cyclonedx.org/about/participate/) in the development of the 
[standard and supporting tools](https://github.com/CycloneDX).

### Background
Modern software is assembled using third-party and open source components. They are glued together in complex and 
unique ways and integrated with original code to achieve the desired functionality. An accurate inventory of all 
components enables organizations to identify risk, allows for greater transparency, and enables rapid impact analysis.

CycloneDX was created for this purpose.

Strategic direction and maintenance of the [specification](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/latest) is managed by 
the [CycloneDX Core Working Group](https://cyclonedx.org/about/working-groups/).
