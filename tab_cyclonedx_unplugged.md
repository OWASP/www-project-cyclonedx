## CycloneDX Unplugged

CycloneDX Unplugged is a community showcase of commercial and open source projects that support or interoperate with 
the OWASP CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) standard. CycloneDX Unplugged is part of the 
[CycloneDX YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcUKDc0izYoyQKdzAsraoUQ).

A focus of the playlist is on the creation, consumption, analysis, conversion, and distribution of CycloneDX along the 
tools and processes that serve to better operationalize SBOMs for greater transparency and cybersecurity risk reduction.

Details are still being finalized. More info to come. Stay tuned...
