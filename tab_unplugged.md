## CycloneDX Unplugged

CycloneDX Unplugged is a community showcase of commercial and open source projects that support or interoperate with 
the OWASP CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) standard. CycloneDX Unplugged is part of the 
[CycloneDX YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcUKDc0izYoyQKdzAsraoUQ).

A focus of the playlist is on the creation, consumption, analysis, conversion, and distribution of CycloneDX along with 
the tools and processes that serve to better operationalize SBOMs for greater transparency and cybersecurity risk reduction.

* Any commercial or open source project that consumes, analyzes, produces, or distributes CycloneDX SBOMs.
* All projects or vendors have a limit of 3 videos that will be publicly listed at any given time.
* Videos must not exceed 15 minutes.
* Videos must be factual and describe capabilities currently available.
* Videos may be self-produced, or produced in collaboration with the CycloneDX Core Working Group.
* All videos will be edited to include a standardized intro.
